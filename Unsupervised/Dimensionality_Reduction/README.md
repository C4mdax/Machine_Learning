# Dimensionality Reduction
Dimensionality reduction technique to reduce the number of features(dimensions) in a dataset while preserving its important properties. It helps simplify models, improve computational efficiency, and mitigate issues like overfitting and the curse of dimensionality.

## How it works
Dimensionality Reduction works by transforming a dataset from a high-dimensional space into a lower-dimensional space while preserving the essential structure and relationships within the data.

## Commong Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms/Techniques
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
