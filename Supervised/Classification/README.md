# Classification
Classification in supervised learning is a technique where a model  learn to categorize data into predefined classes or labels based on labeled training data.

## How it works
### Phases
#### Training Phase
The model is trained on a labeled dataset, where each input data point is associated with a specific category or label. For example, in an image classification task, each image (input) is labeled as "cat", "dog", or "bird".

#### Learning Patterns
During training, the model learns to identify patterns or features in the input data that correspond to each label. It adjusts its internal parameters to minimize the difference between its predicted laberls and the actual labels in the draining data.

#### Prediction Phase
Once trained, the model can classify new, unseen data. It takes a new input, analyzes it based on learned patterns, and assigns it to one of the predefined classes.

#### Evaluation
The model's accuracy is often measured using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine how well it categorizes data.
