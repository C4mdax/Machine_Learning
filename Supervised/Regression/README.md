# Regression
Regression technique is used to predict a continuous outcome based on one for more input features.

## How it works
The algorithm fits a straight line to the data, expressed as a linear function $$f(x) = mx + b$$, where $y$ is the predicted value, $x$ is the input, $m$ is the slope, and $b$ is the $y$-intercept.

## Common Regression Algorithms/Techniques
- Linear Regression (simple and multiple)
- Logistic Regression
- Polynomial Regression
