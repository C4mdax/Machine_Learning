## P1: Math Foundations

### Calculus
#### Functions
- Algebraic Functions (concept, notion and behavior)
- Transcendent Functions (concept, notion and behavior)

#### Derivatives
- Derivatives rules (chain rule, product rule, quotient rule)
- Maxima and Minima
- Optimization Problems

#### Integrals
- Concept and definition
- Integral rules
- Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
- Applications of Integrals (area and volumes, general concepts, accumulation)

### Linear Algebra
#### Vectors
- Vector operations (Addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, and dot product).
- Geometric Interpretation (geometric terms such as direction and magnitude).

#### Matrices
- Matrix operations (Addition, substraction, multiplication and transposition).
- Types of Matrices (Identity, diagonal, symmetric, sparse). 
- Determinant. 

#### Systems of Linear Equations
- Consistent and Inconsistent systems.
- Homogeneous and Non-Homogeneous systems. 
- Methods of Solving. 
- Geometric Interpretation. 

#### Vector Spaces

- Fields. 
- Vector Spaces 
- Vector Subspaces

#### Linear Independence
- Definition
- Rank of a Matrix
- Row reduction

#### Basis and Rank
- Definition
- Rank of a Matrix 
- Relationship between Basis and Rank

#### Linear Mappings
- Definition and Types (injective (one-to-one), surjective (onto) and bijective (both))
- Matrix Representation and Change of Basis
